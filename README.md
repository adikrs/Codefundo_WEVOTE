Our app demonstration for improving voting system.

PROBLEMS WITH ELECTIONS IN INDIA
Elections are under threat from malicious actors that can infiltrate voting machines, alter voter registration databases, coordinated disinformation campaigns, and more. Moreover, problems like EVM hacking are also a very big issue to solve. 
                     HOW CAN OUR APPLICATION HELP
Our application- WE VOTE uses Blockchain Technology to improve the system of voting in the nations. Election security involves the protection of election processes and critical voting infrastructure from cyber attacks. Elements in need of protection include registration databases, voting machines, other systems to manage the election, and systems that report & display results. Blockchain is being touted as a new way to make elections more secure.
Blockchain’s fundamental characteristics — transparency, immutability, and accountability — underscore the technology’s potential for securing elections. One time login is the main feature that will ensure that each person votes only once.
PRE ELECTION PROCESS
Blockchain elections require an assortment of identity data — such as government-issued IDs and biometric data collected during online registration — to match a voter with his or her digital identity in a government voter registration database. Increasingly, biometrics like iris and face data are being used to prove identity in conjunction with voting on the blockchain. We can also include Video Recognition technique for more security purposes where the voter needs to upload a video of a maximum of 5 seconds and he/she will be identified using Face Recognition technique.
DURING ELECTIONS
A voter must provide a phone number and an eight-digit pin and submit a photo of his or her driver’s license. The voter must then they shoot and submit a video of their face, which is then processed by facial recognition technology that can confirm (or not confirm) that the face in the video belongs to the same person registered as a state voter.
With a public blockchain, each voter would be allowed to audit each ballot to confirm that reported vote totals are accurate, without revealing the identity or vote choice of each voter.
ADVANTAGES OF USING OUR APPLICATION
The future will surely see Blockchain technology being brought hooked on the thought all due to electronic ledgers, which might do the duty of list, maintaining moreover as compartmentalization all of the records and communicating the knowledge that's hold on all told of them. It will transform the method of govt. services and advantages are delivered to the people, do away with pilferages within the delivery of such services wherever this can be a big downside, eliminate leakages in tax collection, delivery, and management of documents like passport, social identify cards, EHRs, and maintenance of key registries (like land and vehicle).
It will be offered exclusively to active-duty military, their eligible dependents and overseas voters using their smartphones.
Our application also provides a feature of providing all the information, the manifesto of the candidates in the regional languages. This is one of the biggest problems in India where people face problem in understanding languages like Hindi and English. They can easily choose the right candidate by knowing about the Candidates.
Thus, this is our idea and we will implement it practically.
